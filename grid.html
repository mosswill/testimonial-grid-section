                        the free intro course and found it incredibly! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
                        weeks was the best - and most gruelling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've

                    <p>"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
                        professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by
                        a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire
                        curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait
                        long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
                        learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often
                        referred to it during Interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly
                        helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
                        recommend!"
